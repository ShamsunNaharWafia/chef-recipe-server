When he was an elementary school student, he was given some biscuits, but he had to fry them with butter and sprinkle them with sugar. He claims his father was also a picky eater, which made him more interested in cooking. When he was a student, his father would buy ten hamburgers at a time on his way home after a business trip. Baek Jong-won would try different recipes to make the hamburgers taste better. It was from then that he started to cook",
